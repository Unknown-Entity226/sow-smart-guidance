# AI-Driven Crop Advisory and Farmer Assistance Platform

## Problem Statement
Indian farmers often lack access to reliable, personalized, and localized agricultural guidance. Information related to crop selection, disease management, government schemes, and direct market access is scattered, non-intuitive, and rarely available in regional languages.

This project proposes an AI-based crop advisory web platform that delivers end-to-end decision support to farmers, from crop selection to post-harvest selling, with full multilingual support for 22 Indian languages.

---

## Objectives
- Provide personalized crop recommendations using farmer-specific data
- Enable data-driven agricultural decision-making
- Increase awareness of MSP, market prices, subsidies, NGOs, and startups
- Reduce farmer dependency on middlemen
- Ensure inclusivity through multilingual accessibility

---

## System Overview

### High-Level Workflow
1. Farmer accesses the website  
2. Farmer fills a structured data collection form  
3. AI engine processes inputs and generates crop recommendations  
4. Farmer selects a recommended crop  
5. System displays detailed crop, market, and support information  
6. Continuous advisory and post-harvest recommendations are provided

## Farmer Input Parameters

| Category | Details |
|--------|--------|
| Personal Details | Name, Location, Valid Identity Number |
| Farm Information | Farm Size, Budget |
| Workforce | Number of Working Members |
| Crop History | Previously Cultivated Crops |

---

## Crop Recommendation Module

### AI Logic Considers
- Historical crop data  
- Regional climatic suitability  
- Budget and resource constraints  
- Crop rotation principles  
- Availability of labor and machinery  

### Output
- Ranked list of the most suitable crops for the farmer’s land

## Crop Insight Module

Once a farmer selects a crop, the system displays:

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|------------|
| MSP | Government Minimum Support Price |
| Market Rate | Average or real-time market price |
| Estimated Cost | Cultivation and input costs |
| Time Period | Sowing to harvesting duration |
| Diseases | Common crop diseases |
| Fertilizers | Optimal fertilizer recommendations |
| Disease Solutions | Preventive and corrective measures |
| Subsidies | Relevant government schemes |
| Seed Access | Nearby NGOs and startup initiatives |

---

## Post-Harvest Intelligence System

- Tracks the crop lifecycle
- Two weeks before harvest, the farmer receives:
  - Next crop recommendations
  - Crop rotation suggestions
  - Seasonal planning guidance

This enables continuous agricultural planning instead of single-cycle advisory.

---

## Market and Selling Assistance
The platform provides:
- Direct-to-consumer selling platforms
- Marketplace and mandi information
- Agricultural e-commerce websites
- Market price awareness to reduce exploitation

---

## Smart Machinery Recommendation System
- Budget-aware machinery recommendations
- Purchase links from verified platforms
- Seasonal relevance analysis
- Long-term productivity and ROI focus

---

## Multilingual Support

The platform supports 22 Indian languages, including:

Hindi, English, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam, Punjabi, Assamese, Maithili, Sanskrit, Konkani, Dogri, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Manipuri, Bodo, Santhali.

Language switching is enabled through a real-time translation toggle.
